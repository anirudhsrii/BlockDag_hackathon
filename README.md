# SentinelAI: AI-Powered Smart Contract Security

SentinelAI is a proactive, scalable, and intelligent solution to combat widespread vulnerabilities and costly exploits in the blockchain ecosystem. The system protects decentralized applications (dApps) and user assets by moving beyond reactive manual audits.

## Project Components

1. **Smart Contracts** - Solidity contracts for vulnerability detection and monitoring
2. **Backend** - Python-based AI/ML core using TensorFlow/PyTorch for smart contract analysis
3. **Frontend** - React.js dashboard for intuitive user interaction

## Features

- Pre-deployment smart contract vulnerability analysis
- Real-time on-chain transaction monitoring
- Anomaly and malicious activity detection
- User-friendly dashboard for security insights

## Target Users

- Smart contract developers
- dApp development teams
- DeFi protocols
- Independent blockchain auditors
